/*
4. You operate several hot dog stands distributed throughout town.
Define a class named HotDogStand
	that has a member variable for the hot dog standï¿½s ID number
	and a member variable for how many hot dogs the stand sold that day.
Create a constructor that allows a user of the class to initialize both values.
Also create a function named JustSold that increments the number of hot dogs the stand has sold by one.
	This function will be invoked each time the stand sells a hot dog
	so that you can track the total number of hot dogs sold by the stand.
Add another function that returns the number of hot dogs sold.
Finally, add a static variable that tracks the total number of hot dogs sold by all hot dog stands
	and a static function that returns the value in this variable.
Write a main function to test your class
	with at least three hot dog stands
	that each sell a variety of hot dogs.
